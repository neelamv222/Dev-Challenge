            <h1>Updating Table</h1>
            <p>
                This page is served from <code>dev-challenge/site/index.html</code>.  To get set up, go into the
                dev-challenge directory and run <code>npm install</code>.  To start the server, run
                <code>npm start</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                It includes javascript code bundled starting at <code>challenge/index.js</code> and
                also a javascript library called <a href="http://jmesnil.net/stomp-websocket/doc/">stomp.js</a>
                for connecting to a streaming pub/sub system over websockets.  Within a short time from loading
                the page, it will connect over websockets to a stomp server that also runs when you run the
                development server.
            </p>
            <section id="stomp-status">
                It hasn't yet connected to the stomp server.  If this state persists for a significant length of time, check
                <ul>
                    <li>that you are running a browser that supports javascript and WebSockets</li>
                    <li>that you have run the development server by going into the db-updating-table directory and
                        run it by running <code>npm start</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>that there were no errors during the development server starting (e.g. perhaps port
                        8011 was taken)
                    </li>
                    <li>that you are accessing it through that dev server, at <a href="http://localhost:8011">http://localhost:8011</a>
                        and that no errors are appearing in your browsers console.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                If none of that works, then ask for help by emailing <a href="mailto:adam.iley@db.com">adam.iley@db.com</a>.

            <h2>Your Task</h2>
            <p>
                Your task is to show those currency pairs in a table with rows for each currency pair, which
                includes columns for at least the name, the current best bid price, current best ask price,
                the amount that the best bid last changed, and the amount the best ask price last changed.
                This data can be read out of the price updates that are sent via stomp.  You should request the topic
                <code>/fx/prices</code>, to receive update messages with a body that looks like this:
            </p>
            <pre>{
  "name": "usdjpy",
  "bestBid": 106.7297012204255,
  "bestAsk": 107.25199883791178,
  "openBid": 107.22827132623534,
  "openAsk": 109.78172867376465,
  "lastChangeAsk": -4.862314256927661,
  "lastChangeBid": -2.8769211401569663
}</pre>
            <p>
                To make the task more interesting, the table should be sorted (and remain sorted) by the column
                that indicates how much the best bid price last changed (lastChangeBid in the response data).
            </p>
            <h2>Restrictions</h2>
            <p>
                Because we want to assess your javascript programming ability, there is a requirement that you do
                not use libraries or frameworks that you haven't written yourself for the updating table.
                We mean this seriously.  Do not include any script tags beyond ones that reference the bundled
                javascript or the stomp library.  Do not npm install any new dependencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although adding dependencies you haven't written yourself to the page that features the updating table
                is not allowed, dependencies that you only use during build or development e.g. for testing, etc are
                allowed.
            </p>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>
                We want you to submit a modification of this project where this index.html page has been replaced
                with a page showing the live updating table of sorted data.  This page should also mention or link to
                anything else you want us to consider.  For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anything you had to change or assume about this task to make your solution</li>
                <li>A high level description of your approach</li>
                <li>If you added any other development-time steps, what they are, why you added them and how to run them</li>
                <li>Which libraries/frameworks you would have liked to have used (if any), and how they would have made
                    the result better
                </li>
                <li>You should include your name and email address so if we have trouble running it we can get in
                    touch with you easily
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                You should zip the project.  I want to be able to unzip it, go into the resulting folder,
                run <code>npm start</code>, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8011/</code> and see the result.
                You should be careful not to include anything excessively platform specific, as I may use a mac
                or windows to do this.
            </p>
